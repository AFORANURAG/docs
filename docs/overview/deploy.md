# Deploy

We pre-provision AWS serverless infrastructure to make every deployment, even the first, super fast. This means we are able to deploy in seconds. Usually about 6 seconds for apps with a few dependencies. It can take longer if your app has a long build step (nextjs for example).

For deployments that take place into Cyclic managed accounts this means there is nothing else to worry about. The deployments are so easy and fast there really isn't anything else to say.
