# Deploy

We pre-provision AWS serverless infrastructure to make every deployment, even the first, super fast. This means we are able to deploy in seconds. Usually about 6 seconds for apps with a few dependencies. It can take longer if your app has a long build step (nextjs for example).

For deployments that take place into Cyclic managed accounts 

The deployments are so easy and fast there really isn't anything else to say.
