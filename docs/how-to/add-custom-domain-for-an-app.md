# Adding a custom domain to an app

Cyclic apps are given random subdomain names at first deployment. The general structure of a name is - 

`some-random-words.cyclic.app` 

You can customize this domain in two ways:

## Custom subdomain

To change the subdomain to something like `myproject.cyclic.app` , navigate to `Environments` and use the form in the `Custom Subdomain` panel. You will be able to select a any custom domain that hasn't already been used.

## Adding a domain you own to an app

You can attach a domain you own to a Cyclic app.
